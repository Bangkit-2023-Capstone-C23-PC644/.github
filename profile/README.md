🍿 **Backgrounder**

The inspiration behind making this app  is to improve the patient experience and streamline the healthcare process. Hospitals can be a busy and overwhelming place, with long wait times and confusing queues.  MOC can help inform hospitals and patients about live hospital quotas.  MOC can help users and patient check in real time if their queue number is approaching so that they can arrive at the hospital on time and their time is not wasted.

Utilizing Hospital Software will make it easier for patients to enjoy existing facilities and hospital management in managing their service system. Not only does it improve service efficiency, this app can also save hospital expenses significantly by monitoring through a well-integrated system.
